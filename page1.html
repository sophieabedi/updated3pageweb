    <p><b>What is a queen bee?</b></p>
    <p>A queen bee is the one that produces eggs. She can
      lay as many as 2,000 eggs every day. Queen bees are only
      useful for about 2-3 years but can live for 5 years.
      They produce substances such as the queen substance which is
      a "mixture of chemicals" that "is passed individually from bee to bee throughout
      the entire hive as they share food."</p>

      <p><b>What is a drone bee?</b></p>
      <p>Drone bees are larger bees whose primary purpose is to mate with the queen
      They compete with other male bees to mate with the queen, and is one of the
        most important parts of a bee colony. Drone bees die when worker bees kick
        them out of the hive.</p>

      <p><b>What is a worker bee?</b></p>
      <p>Worker bees are predominately female and control what
        goes on inside the hive as well as do most of the work
        They live for about 6 weeks but do a lot of work during
        their lives such as feeding the queens, collecting pollen
        and housekeeping.</p>
