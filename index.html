    <p>Honey Bees are one of the most important aspects
      of pollinating flowers. 70/100 crops are pollinated by bees.
       The issue is how bees are dying. Pesticides, drought, habitat destruction,
       nutrition deficiency, global warming, and air pollution are one of the few
       ways bees can die. The most important part is how humans affect this, as
       pesticides and habitat loss are predominately caused by humans.
       Winter is also an issue that plays into this. Bees cannot keep
       up with dying out every winter especially since they lose about
       5-10% of bees every winter. No matter the cause, a lot of issues lead
        back to humans. The destruction of habitat and over use of pesticide
        kills off so many bees that they have decreased by 90% since 1962.
